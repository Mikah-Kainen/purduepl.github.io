I am an Assistant Professor of the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, where I lead the Learning Systems Group. Previously, I was an NSF Computing Innovation Fellow and Postdoctoral Associate at MIT CSAIL mentored by Michael Carbin. During my postdoc, I also held an visiting position at Meta Infra Data Center to improve maintenance efficiency of millions of servers in real-world hyperscale datacenters. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from The University of Chicago advised by Henry Hoffmann.

My research interests are in the broad areas of computer systems, computer architecture, and machine learning, with a recent focus on sustainable cloud computing, and causal inference for distributed systems.
