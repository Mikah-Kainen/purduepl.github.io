bio: "My name is Samia Kabir and I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Purdue University. My research interest is in the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Information Visualization, and Human-AI Interaction. I am currently a part of the Human-Centered Software Systems Lab at Purdue, working under the supervision of [Dr. Tianyi Zhang](https://tianyi-zhang.github.io/) .
My research projects at Purdue focus on the socio-technical aspects of Large Language Models (LLM). I empirically study the correctness and quality issues of LLMs, and build interactive tools that can aid end-users in analyzing and understanding issues such as misinformation or stereotypes hidden in LLMs."

Q&A platforms have been crucial for the online help-seeking behavior of programmers. However, the recent popularity of ChatGPT is altering this trend. Despite this popularity, no comprehensive study has been conducted to evaluate the characteristics of ChatGPTâ€™s answers to programming questions. To bridge the gap, we conducted the first in-depth analysis of ChatGPT answers to 517 programming questions on Stack Overflow and examined the correctness, consistency, comprehensiveness, and conciseness of ChatGPT answers. Furthermore, we conducted a large-scale linguistic analysis, as well as a user study, to understand the characteristics of ChatGPT answers from linguistic and human aspects. Our analysis shows that 52% of ChatGPT answers contain incorrect information and 77% are verbose. Nonetheless, our user study participants still preferred ChatGPT answers 35% of the time due to their comprehensiveness and well-articulated language style. However, they also overlooked the misinformation in the ChatGPT answers 39% of the time. This implies the need to counter misinformation in ChatGPT answers to programming questions and raise awareness of the risks associated with seemingly correct answers.
