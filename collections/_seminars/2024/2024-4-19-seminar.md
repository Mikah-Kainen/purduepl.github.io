High-performance implementations of k-Nearest Neighbor Search (kNN) in low dimensions use tree-based data structures. Tree algorithms are hard to parallelize on GPUs due to their irregularity.  However, newer Nvidia GPUs offer hardware support for tree operations through ray-tracing cores.  Recent works have proposed using RT cores to implement kNN search, but they all have a hardware-imposed constraint on the distance metric used in the search---the Euclidean distance.  We propose and implement two reductions to support kNN for a broad range of distances other than the Euclidean distance: Arkade Filter-Refine and Arkade Monotone Transformation, each of which allows non-Euclidean distance-based nearest neighbor queries to be performed in terms of the Euclidean distance. With our reductions, we observe that kNN search time speedups range between 1.5x-200x over various state-of-the-art GPU baselines and datasets. In evaluation, we provide several insights on RT architectures' ability to efficiently build and traverse the tree by analyzing the kNN search time trends.
