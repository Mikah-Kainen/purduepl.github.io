Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables secure processing on encrypted data,
maintaining privacy across a range of applications. However, the practical
implementation of FHE has been constrained by substantial computational
overhead. Recent research has explored vectorization strategies to optimize FHE
computations, yet it often overlooks the problem of excessive vector operand
rotations in encrypted circuits. This research talk leverages Coyote, an
effective FHE compiler, capable of vectorizing computational kernels while
minimizing rotations. Coyote, however, encounters challenges with large circuits
which can lead to excessive rotations and lengthy compilation times. To address
this challenge, we introduce PEAVS, an approach that breaks down extensive
arithmetic circuits into smaller replicated subcircuits, vectorizes these
subcircuits, and then composes them back into a schedule for the larger circuit.
We demonstrate that this strategy significantly improves compilation times,
reduces excessive rotations, and minimizes vector instructions, resulting in
more efficient and scalable compilation for large circuits.
